# Multimodal toxicity detection
This repository contains code and trained models for my bachelor's thesis on the topic "Multimodal toxicity detection in the online space with a focus on multimodality of datasets".

# Dataset retrieval
Models are trained on the Multimodal Hate Speech Dataset (MMHS150K), available [here.](https://gombru.github.io/2019/10/09/MMHS/)
To use, unpack the ZIP archive into `<repo root>/data/MMHS150K/`.
